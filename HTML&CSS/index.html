      Designing the UI for the Lions Club has been an exciting experience,
      focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The
      goal was to reflect the clubâ€™s values while ensuring easy navigation and
      accessibility for all users. From intuitive layouts to cohesive branding,
      this design aims to enhance the user experience and support the Lions
      Club's mission effectively.
